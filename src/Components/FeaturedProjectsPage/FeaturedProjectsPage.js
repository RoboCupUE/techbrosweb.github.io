        <h2>MiniSumo Robot Design for Internal Competition</h2>
        <div className="project-details">
          <div className="project-description">
            <p>
              Our internal competition focuses on designing and building MiniSumo robots that will compete against each other in a specially designed arena. The goal is to create a robot that can autonomously detect and push its opponent out of the ring.
            </p>
            <p>
              This project allows our team members to work on various aspects of robotics, such as motor control, sensor integration, and algorithm development, while also promoting friendly competition and teamwork.
