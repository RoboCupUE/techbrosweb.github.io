      <h1>RoboCup Liga Home 2025</h1>
      <p>
        Our team is working towards participating in the RoboCup Liga Home 2025, a prestigious international event in the field of robotics, where we will showcase the latest advancements in social robotics and autonomous systems. In this competition, we face the challenge of developing a robot capable of assisting humans with everyday tasks at home.
      </p>
      <p>
        To tackle this challenge, we are building our robot using the TurtleBot 4, a modular platform that allows us to efficiently integrate advanced technologies. The TurtleBot 4 provides the perfect foundation for developing an autonomous robot that can perform tasks such as navigation, object manipulation, and seamless human interaction.
      </p>
      <p>
        This project focuses on the integration of speech recognition, human-robot interaction, and artificial intelligenceâ€”key technologies that enable the robot to understand its environment and collaborate with humans in everyday scenarios. Additionally, our robot will be able to make intelligent decisions, navigate complex environments, and adapt to dynamic changes within a home.
      </p>
      <p>
        Through our participation in RoboCup Liga Home 2025, we aim not only to showcase our technological capabilities but also to contribute to the development of social robots that can improve people's quality of life by providing assistance with household tasks in an autonomous and reliable manner.
      </p>
      <p>
        This project challenges us to integrate technologies like speech recognition, human-robot interaction, and AI-based decision-making. Our innovative robots will be able to perform tasks, navigate complex environments, and interact seamlessly with humans.
