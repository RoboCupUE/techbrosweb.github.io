      <h1>ASTI Challenge 2025</h1>
      <p>
        We are preparing to participate in the ASTI Robotics Challenge, a prominent robotics competition in Spain that encourages the development of mobile robotics projects. This year, we are competing in the university category, where teams are tasked with designing, building, and prototyping autonomous robots that can perform complex tasks.
      </p>
      <p>
        The competition is structured in multiple phases, starting with regional semifinals held in cities like Valencia, Madrid, and Zaragoza. If successful, teams progress to the national final in Burgos, where the best projects compete. Participants face a series of challenges that test their skills in areas like artificial intelligence, system integration, and navigation. The goal is to create robots that can autonomously solve real-world problems, such as navigating complex environments and performing specific tasks.
      </p>
      <p>
        This challenge not only enhances our technical expertise but also promotes teamwork and project management skills. It provides us with an invaluable opportunity to apply our knowledge in a competitive, real-world scenario and work alongside other passionate students to push the boundaries of roboticsâ€‹
      </p>
      <p>
        The challenge involves solving real-world problems, enhancing our technical knowledge, and fostering teamwork. The competition will test our skills in AI, system integration, and autonomous navigation.
